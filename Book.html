            <h2><u>Hunger Games: Mocking Jay</u></h2>
            <p class="book">This book changed my life because I found it at the right time in my youth.
                <br>Although looking back I do not find this to be a a good book, the characters and scenarios felt alive just because I willed them to be. 
                <br>Even though I have read many captivating stories since then, this holds a special place in my heart just because it influenced me.
                <br>This was the first time that I had followed a character for multiple books and watching her grow made the world feel very important and sucked me right in.</p>
